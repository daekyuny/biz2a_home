<h2>The fate of a golfer's wife</h2>
<p>It's a nice hot summers day and two men are playing golf on a course that 
is situated near a main road. As he is just about to tee off on the 10th hole 
one of the men notices a hearse driving slowly along the road. He stops in mid 
swing and places his club on the ground, turns round, faces the road and removes 
his hat in a solemn gesture. The second man turns round to him and says...</p>
<p>M2: ``Come off it, it's only a hearse.''</p>
<p>M1: ``But you don't understand, its my wife's funeral...''</p>
