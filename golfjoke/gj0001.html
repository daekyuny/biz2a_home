                <p>One night a man returns home well after dark after having supposedly left at 6:30 that morning to play golf. His wife is furious and demands to know where he's been.</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"Well, I got up this morning at 6:30, went to the car and it wouldn't start. So I called Frank to drive and it was 7:15 until he could pick me up. On our way to the course, Frank gets a flat tire so we have to walk 8 miles to the nearest station to get someone to help us. By the time we finally get going again it's 10:30. When we get to the course, there is a seniors group going off so we have to wait two hours before we can tee off."</p>

                <p>"Yeah, but that was still almost eleven hours ago!" His wife nagged.</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"Well, we were playing along when on the fifth hole a golf ball comes whizzing by and strikes Frank in the head, killing him. So for the next thirteen holes, it's hit the ball, drag Frank, hit the ball, drag Frank, hit the ball...."</p>
