<h2>How does he putt ?</h2>
<p>The pro at the country club was rude. When he beat you on the golf course 
he not only took your money he then told you everything you did wrong and suggested 
that you would never be able to hit the ball out of your own shadow.</p>
<p>On of the members had enough. So we bought a gorilla and trained it to play 
golf. </p>
<p>He then set up a game with the pro, $1000 a side with automatics.</p>
<p>The day of the match arrived and all parties were ready. The first hole was 
a par five of 575 yards. The pro teed off splitting the fairway some 270 yards 
out.</p>
<p>The gorilla lumbered up to the tee. Placed the ball on the ground and made 
a mighty swing. The ball rocketed off the clubface 100, 200, 300 400 ,500, 575 
yards and stopped 5 inches from the cup.</p>
<p>The pro just about ``dumped'' in his pants. If this was an indication of 
the way things were going to go then he would never live in down. He immediately 
settled the bet, remembering that he had urgent business across town. </p>
<p>As they walked from the tee the pro asked, ``How does he putt''</p>
<p>The same as he drives, 575 yards, was the answer.</p>
