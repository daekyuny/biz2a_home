<h2>How hard to hit a 1-iron ?</h2>
<p>A rather good golf junkie who happens to be a priest is on the 18th hole 
and has about a 200 yard approach shot to the green. He drags out his 1-iron, 
and starts to swing at the ball. Suddenly, the clouds overhead let out a flash 
of lightning and a massive roll of thunder, shattering a tree some 3 hundred 
yards east, and the rain begins pouring down in a blinding sheet.</p>
<p>The distraction causes him to hook the shot badly out of bounds. He waves 
his 1-iron at the clouds, screaming and yelling and cursing God. His caddy runs 
up, grabs his club arm and yanks it down, yelling ``Are you crazy? You don't 
wave a club around like that in a thunderstorm!'' The priest looks at his caddy 
and says </p>
<p>``Phhhhhtt. Not even God can hit a 1-iron!''.</p>
