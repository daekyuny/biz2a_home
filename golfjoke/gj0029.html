<h2>The most cruel punishment</h2>
<p>A rabbi is out of town on Yom Kippur. Since nobody knows who he is, he decides 
to play a round of golf. Up in heaven, God sees him and decides to punish the 
rabbi for his transgression. However, before God does anything, Moses stops 
him and says, ``Let me take care of this.'' God thinks about it for a moment 
and say ``Ok.''</p>
<p>The rabbi tes off on the first hole, and from above, Moses causes the ball 
to be a perfect hole in one. This is repeated for the second hole, the third 
hole, in fact, for every hole on the course. The rabbi has hit a perfect game.</p>
<p>God turns to Moses and says ``I thought you were going to punish him?'', 
to which Moses replies, ``Who's he going to tell?''</p>
