<h2>Jesus!, What a golfer! (1)</h2>
<p>Jesus and Moses are playing golf. On the 5th hole, a shot over water to an 
island green, Moses hits his 6-iron and it lands perfectly on the green. Jesus 
takes out his 7-iron and begins tee-ing it up. </p>
<p>Moses says: ``The 7 isn't enough club. It'll go in the water'' </p>
<p>Jesus replies: ``If Arnie Palmer can do it, I can do it.'' </p>
<p>He swings the 7 and sure enough, right in the drink. He tees up a second 
ball and grabs his 7-iron again. Once again Moses reminds him of his previous 
attempt and Jesus says, ``If Arnie Palmer can do it, I can do it.'' ``PLOP'' 
in the water it goes again. He continues this until he has hit all his golf 
balls into the water. At this point, he begins walking out on the water looking 
down to locate his lost golf balls. The foursome behind them approaches the 
tee, spots Jesus out on the lake nd says to Moses,</p>
<p>``Hey, who does that guy think he is, Jesus Christ?'' </p>
<p>Moses replies, </p>
<p>``No, Arnie Palmer.''</p>
