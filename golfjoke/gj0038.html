                <p>It seems that four very low-handicapped players were playing their normal course. Unusually, the play was very slow and the players began to get frustrated. By the tenth hole, they began firing their tee shots at the foursome ahead of them, who were constantly in the woods and were the root cause of the slow play. Finally, the good foursome finished their round, coming in just under eight hours. After spotting the slow group in the clubhouse, they went right after them, swearing their asses off. The club pro saw this spectacle and pulled aside the guys. He said: <span class="quote-style">"Didn't you know that the foursome ahead of you are all *blind*; they're taking part in a special event."</span> After hearing this, the foursome immediately had a change of heart. The first one said, <span class="quote-style">"Just to show how sorry I am, I'll pay for their green fees."</span> The second replied, <span class="quote-style">"And I'll pay for their carts."</span> Predictably, the third member said, <span class="quote-style">"Whatever food and drinks they want, I'll pay for them."</span> The club pro considered their acts very gracious and, turning to the fourth member, said: <span class="quote-style">"And what are you going to do for them?"</span> The golfer, still noticeably upset, retorted,</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"Fuck them, they could have played last night!"</p>
