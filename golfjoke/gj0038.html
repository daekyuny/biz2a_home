<h2>No Excuse !!</h2>
<p>It seems that four very low-handicapped players were playing their normal 
course. Unusually, the play was very slow and the players began to get frustrated. 
By the tenth hole, they began firing their tee shots at the foursome ahead of 
them, who were constantly in the woods and were the root cause of the slow play. 
Finally, the good foursome finished their round, coming in just under eight 
hours. After spotting the slow group in the clubhouse, they went right after 
them, swearing their asses off. The club pro saw this spectacle and pulled aside 
the guys. He said: ``Didn't you know that the foursome ahead of you are all 
*blind*; they're taking part in a special event.'' After hearing this, the foursome 
immediately had a change of heart. The first one said, ``Just to show how sorry 
I am, I'll pay for their green fees.'' The second replied, ``And I'll pay for 
their carts.'' Predictably, the third member said, ``Whatever food and drinks 
they want, I'll pay for them.'' The club pro considered their acts very gracious 
and, turning to the fourth member, said: ``And what are you going to do for 
them?'' The golfer, still noticeably upset, retorted, </p>
<p>``Fuck them, they could have played last night!''</p>
