            <div class="joke-content">
                <p>He was out playing a round of golf one day with three of his friends, who were also ministers, when on one of the par fives he reaches the edge of the green in three, leaving himself with about a 35-40 foot birdie putt.</p>

                <p>He lines the putt up so that he feels pretty comfortable with it and strikes what looks to be a perfect putt, headed straight for the hole. Just as the ball gets to the hole, it stops, hanging right on the rim of the hole. Being a preacher and a man of God, he looks up to the sky and says to God, <span class="quote-style">"How 'bout a little help?"</span></p>

                <p>Just as he says this, a moth flies onto the green, briefly buzzes around their heads and then decides to rest....RIGHT ON HIS BALL!!! The moth lands on the ball but the ball still doesn't move, prompting him to say <span class="quote-style">"YOU DIDN'T SEND A BIG ENOUGH MOTH!!!"</span> Right when he says this, the moth starts crawling around the ball, and eventually crawls to the hole side of the ball, causing, you guessed it, the ball to drop straight into the hole. With this my friend simply looks up to the sky with an <span class="quote-style">"Amen!"</span></p>
