<h2>Preacher's Call</h2>
<p>He was out playing a round of golf one day with three of his friends, who 
were also ministers, when on one of the par fives he reaches the edge of the 
green in three, Leaving himself with about a 35-40 foot birdie putt.</p>
<p>He lines the putt up so that he feels pretty comfortable with it and strikes 
what looks to be a perfect putt, headed straight for the hole. Just as the ball 
gets to the hole, it stops, hanging right on the rim of the hole. Being a preacher 
and a man of God, He looks up to the sky and says to God, ``How 'bout a little 
help?''</p>
<p>Just as he says this, a moth flies onto the green, briefly buzzes around 
their heads and then decides to rest....RIGHT ON HIS BALL!!! The moth lands 
on the ball but the ball still doesn't move, prompting him to say ``YOU DIDN'T 
SEND A BIG ENOUGH MOTH!!!'' Right when he says this, the moth starts crawling 
around the ball, and eventually crawls to the hole side of the ball, causing, 
you guessed it, the ball to drop straight into the hole. With this my friend 
simply looks up to the sky with an ``Amen!''</p>
