<h2>An Illusion</h2>
<p>Seems this man was stranded on an island for 11 years...well one day he was 
sitting on the beach when this very lovely lady came swimming up, she had on 
a wet suit that was gripping her body.... she looked at the man, and asked how 
long he had been here....when he said 11 years, she asked if he had smoked any....he 
said no....she then opened a pocket and pulled out a cigarette and lit it and 
gave it to him.....she then asked when was the last time he had a drink.....he 
said 11 years....so she pulled a flask out of another pocket and gave him a 
drink.....the young lady then got a really sexy look on her face and asked when 
was the last time the had played around.... the fellow grinned and said 11 years....at 
the point the young lady started to unzip her wet suit .......the man got so 
excited he responded with </p>
<p>``OH MY GOD YOU MEAN YOU HAVE A SET OF GOLF CLUBS IN THERE!!!!!!!!''</p>
