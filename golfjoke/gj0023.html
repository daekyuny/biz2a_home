            <div class="joke-content">
                <p>Jesus, Moses and Paul were playing golf, and Jesus found himself in a sand trap. He looked at the position of the ball, and decided to use a nine-iron. Moses quickly rebuked Jesus and said <span class="quote-style">"What the heck are you doing? If you use a nine-iron, you're going to land that ball in the drink!"</span></p>

                <p>Jesus answered <span class="quote-style">"No, no, I saw Jack Nicklaus do this on T.V. the other day. I'm sure I can do this."</span> Well, he hit the ball, and right on with Moses' prediction, the ball landed in the lake; so Moses parted the water so Jesus could get the ball. When Jesus insisted trying from the same spot again with a nine-iron, Moses repeated his objection, but Jesus again replied <span class="quote-style">"I saw Jack Nicklaus do this on T.V."</span> Again, the ball landed in the drink, again Moses parted the water for Jesus to go get the ball.</p>

                <p>When Jesus insisted on one more try, Moses retorted <span class="quote-style">"O.K. smarty, but WHEN it lands in the water, I'm not parting it this time!"</span> To this Jesus replied <span class="quote-style">"I saw Jack do this on T.V."</span>, and again, the ball landed in the drink. Moses, true to his word refused to part the water, so Jesus walked out on the water to try and find his ball. A couple of guys walked up and saw a man walking on water, and turned to Moses asking <span class="quote-style">"who is this guy, Jesus Christ?"</span>, to which Moses snaps <span class="quote-style">"Yeah, but he thinks he's Jack Nicklaus."</span> (ugh ugh)</p>
