<h2>Jesus!, What a golfer! (2)</h2>
<p>Jesus, Moses and Paul were playing golf, and Jesus found himself in a sand 
trap. He looked at the position of the ball, and decided to use a nine-iron. 
Moses quickly rebuked Jesus and said ``What the heck are you doing? If you use 
a nine-iron, you're going to land that ball in the drink!'' </p>
<p>Jesus answered ``No, no, I saw Jack Nicholas do this on T.V. the other day. 
I'm sure I can do this.'' Well, he hit the ball, and right on with Moses' prediction, 
the ball landed in the lake; so Moses parted the water so Jesus could get the 
ball. When Jesus insisted trying from the same spot again with a nine-iron, 
Moses repeated his objection, but Jesus again replied ``I saw Jack Nicholas 
do this on T.V.'' Again, the ball landed in the drink, again Moses parted the 
water for Jesus to go get the ball.</p>
<p>When Jesus insisted on one more try, Moses retorted ``O.K. smarty, but WHEN 
it lands in the water, I'm not parting it this time!'' To this Jesus replied 
``I saw Jack do this on T.V.'', and again, the ball landed in the drink. Moses, 
true to his word refused to part the water, so Jesus walked out on the water 
to try and find his ball. A couple of guys walked up and saw a man walking on 
water, and turned to Moses asking ``who is this guy, Jesus Christ?'', to which 
Moses snaps ``Yeah, but he thinks he's Jack Nicholas.'' (ugh ugh)</p>
