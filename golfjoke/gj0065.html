<h2>A true joke ?</h2>
<p>A new inmate in a prison was at the meal table for the first time. One of 
the inmates said, ``Seventeen'', and everyone laughed. Another said, ``Forty-three,'' 
and everyone laughed. Another said, ``Five,'' and got huge gales of laughter.</p>
<p>The new guy asked what was going on. He was told that everyone had been there 
so long that they all knew one another's jokes. So they numbered the jokes to 
save time, and just said the numbers.</p>
<p>The next morning, the new guy waited till everyone was at the table, then 
said, ``Five.'' Dead silence! Why no laughter, he asked. ``Hey, it's not just 
the joke, it's mostly how you tell it.''</p>
