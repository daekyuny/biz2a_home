<h2>Golf Lesson 101 (3)</h2>
<p>One day, a woman decided to take lessons in golf to surprise her husband. 
So she signs up and goes the next day to play. Her instructor says that he'd 
like to see her take a few shots to see how far they go. She stands properly, 
aims and swings.....it goes way off to the left. She tries it again....swings....and 
it goes way off to the right. </p>
<p>``Hum..'' the instructor says, ``I've got an idea. Hold it like you would 
your husband's penis.''</p>
<p>So she aims, swings, and gets a hole in one! </p>
<p>``WOW!'' exclaims the instructor, ``but now this time, try doing that with 
the club out of your mouth.''</p>
