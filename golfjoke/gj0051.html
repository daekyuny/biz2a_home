<h2>The magic of bifocal glasses</h2>
<p>An old man, who plays a round of golf with his pals each week, has just purchased 
a new pair of glasses. At the first hole, he sinks a 30' putt! His friends are 
amazed. Again, on the 2nd and 3rd green, he completes equally difficult shots. 
</p>
<p>``Hey, Harry'', one friend asks, ``what's your secret? You've never played 
so well.'' </p>
<p>``Well guys, its these new bifocals. I see a small ball and a big ball. I 
hit the large one, and the rest is history.''</p>
<p>A few holes later, Harry needs to relieve himself so off into the woods he 
trots. When he returns, his trousers are drenched. </p>
<p>``What happened Harry?''</p>
<p>Harry, in confused voice, </p>
<p>``I reached in and looked down, I saw a big one and a little one. I knew 
the big one wasn't mine, so I put it back!''</p>
