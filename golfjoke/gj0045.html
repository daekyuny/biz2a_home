                <p>A couple of buddies ran into each other at the 19th hole one afternoon. One of the men had a large bandage wrapped around his throat and could speak no louder than a hoarse whisper. Needless to say, the other was quite curious and demanded the details of what had happened. Over a couple of cold ones, the man with the bandage told his tale.</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"Two days ago I came out to the club real early to play a round. At that hour there's not too many people on the course; in fact, the only one I saw was this lady who was playing ahead of me. Anyway, I was hitting them really well - right up until I got to the 7th hole. Just as I was teeing off a bird squawked and I hooked it right into the cow pasture next to the fairway. I grabbed a club and climbed the fence to look for my ball. The lady I told you about was also over there looking for her ball. Well, I looked, but I couldn't find that damned ball anywhere and the lady didn't seem to be having any better luck. Then I noticed this one cow. She seemed to be in pain or something. I went over to take a look at her. At first I couldn't see anything wrong, but then I lifted her tail. Sure enough, there was a ball stuck you-know-where. Well, I checked the markings, but it wasn't mine. So, I yelled out, 'Hey, lady, does this look like yours?' That's when she hit me in the neck with a five iron."</p>
