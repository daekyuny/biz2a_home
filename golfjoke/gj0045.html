<h2>Oh! That is just a wrong place for a golf ball.</h2>
<p>A couple of buddies ran into each other at the 19th hole one afternoon. One 
of the men had a large bandage wrapped around his throat and could speak no 
louder than a hoarse whisper. Needless to say, the other was quite curious and 
demanded the details of what had happened. Over a couple of cold ones, the man 
with the bandage told his tale.</p>
<p>``Two days ago I came out to the club real early to play a round. At that 
hour there's not too many people on the course; in fact, the only one I saw 
was this lady who was playing ahead of me. Anyway, I was hitting them really 
well - right up until I got to the 7th hole. Just as I was teeing off a bird 
squawked and I hooked it right into the cow pasture next to the fairway. I grabbed 
a club and climbed the fence to look for my ball. The lady I told you about 
was also over there looking for her ball. Well, I looked, but I couldn't find 
that damned ball anywhere and the lady didn't seem to be having any better luck. 
Then I noticed this one cow. She seemed to be in pain or something. I went over 
to take a look at her. At first I couldn't see anything wrong, but then I lifted 
her tail. Sure enough, there was a ball stuck you-know-where. Well, I checked 
the markings, but it wasn't mine. So, I yelled out, `Hey, lady, does this look 
like yours?' That's when she hit me in the neck with a five iron.''</p>
