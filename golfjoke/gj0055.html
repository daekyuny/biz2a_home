<h2>Why not use old balls ?</h2>
<p>A fella goes for a quick round of golf, and at the first tee, someone is 
about to tee off in front of him. The man takes a brand new ball out of his 
bag, unwraps it and places it on the tee. Thwack! Slices into the trees. ``Bollocks!'' 
He reaches into his bag and takes out another brand new ball, unwraps it, and 
tees it up. Thwack! Hooks it miles into the bushes.</p>
<p>``Bollocks!'' He stomps back to his bag for another ball, when the man waiting 
approaches him. ``Er, excuse me, but I notice you're losing a lot of brand new 
balls. Why don't you use an old one?'' He looks at the man.</p>
<p>``Cos I've never bloody had one!''</p>
