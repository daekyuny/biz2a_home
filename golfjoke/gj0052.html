<h2>Fatal Provisional</h2>
<p>A guy gets a call from the coroner, who wants to talk about his wife's recent 
death. ``We were on the third hole'' the widower relates. </p>
<p>``My wife was standing on the ladies tee about 30 yards ahead of the men's 
when I hit my drive. From the sound when the ball hit her head and the way she 
dropped like a rock I knew immediately that she was dead. God only knows where 
the ball wound up.'' </p>
<p>The coroner replies ``That explains the injury to her head, but what about 
the Maxfli embedded in her rectum?'' ``Oh'' says the man </p>
<p>``that was my provisional.''</p>
