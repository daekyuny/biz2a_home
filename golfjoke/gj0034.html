<h2>A real disastrous shot</h2>
<p>A man steps up for a tee shot with a row of trees and out of bounds on the 
right side. He slices it wildly and it heads off in the direction of the trees. 
He reloads and forgets about the ball. About 15 minutes later a highway patrolman 
approaches him. </p>
<p>``This your ball?&quot; asks the policeman. </p>
<p>``Yes, I think it is.'' </p>
<p>``Well,'' says the officer, ``it went over the trees and through the window 
of a house. It hit a cat and the cat ran out the front door. A school bus was 
driving by at the time and the driver, while trying to miss the cat, hit a tree. 
The bus exploded in flames, and there were no survivors.'' </p>
<p>``Gee, I'm sorry.'' said the golfer. ``Is there anything I can do?'' The 
policeman replied, </p>
<p>``Well, you might try keeping your left arm a little straighter and start 
your downswing with your hips.''</p>
