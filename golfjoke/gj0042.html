<h2>The game of golf and the marriage</h2>
<p>An avid golfer got married, and the marriage was getting into problems as 
he was playing golf 5 days a week. They finally talked about it and she asks 
him if he could teach her golf, that way they can both enjoy golf and improve 
their marriage. He argues that golf is a serious game and that she is just trying 
to prove her point by mocking the game. After some arguing he agrees to have 
her go to the course with him.</p>
<p>They go to the course and she signs up to take some lessons with the local 
pro. The lessons keep going on everyday, and he is happy she doesn't bother 
him. One day, one of his buddies asks him how the marriage is going. He replies 
``It is great, ever since she takes the golf lessons, she doesn't bother me 
and lets me play all the golf I want.'' His buddy says ``Really, then I guess 
you don't know that she is screwing around with the golf pro'' The man's eyes 
turned red and smoke came out of his ears, getting very furious and saying </p>
<p>``I knew it could not last, I knew she'd make a mockery of the game''</p>
