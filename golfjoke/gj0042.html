                <p>An avid golfer got married, and the marriage was getting into problems as he was playing golf 5 days a week. They finally talked about it and she asks him if he could teach her golf, that way they can both enjoy golf and improve their marriage. He argues that golf is a serious game and that she is just trying to prove her point by mocking the game. After some arguing he agrees to have her go to the course with him.</p>

                <p>They go to the course and she signs up to take some lessons with the local pro. The lessons keep going on everyday, and he is happy she doesn't bother him. One day, one of his buddies asks him how the marriage is going. He replies <span class="quote-style">"It is great, ever since she takes the golf lessons, she doesn't bother me and lets me play all the golf I want."</span> His buddy says <span class="quote-style">"Really, then I guess you don't know that she is screwing around with the golf pro"</span> The man's eyes turned red and smoke came out of his ears, getting very furious and saying</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"I knew it could not last, I knew she'd make a mockery of the game"</p>
