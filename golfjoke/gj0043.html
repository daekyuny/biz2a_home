                <p>The following are borrowed from the May '93 edition of Golf Digest:</p>
                
                <ol style="line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>The score a player reports on any hole should be regarded as his opening offer.</li>
                    
                    <li>When your shot has to carry over a water hazard, you can either hit one more club or two more balls.</li>
                    
                    <li>If you really want to get better at golf, go back and take it up at a much earlier age.</li>
                    
                    <li>When another foursome is on the green, "Fore!" is not an excuse, "So what?" is not an apology, and "Up yours" is not an explanation.</li>
                    
                    <li>Never leave your opponent with the sole responsibility for thinking of all the things that might go wrong with his shot.</li>
                    
                    <li>The only sure way to find a drive sliced deep into the woods is to hit a provisional ball 260 yards down the middle.</li>
                    
                    <li>The stages of a golfer's game are: Sudden Collapse, Radical Change, Complete Frustration, Slow Improvement, Brief Mastery, and Sudden Collapse.</li>
                    
                    <li>Four days of perfect weather begin on Monday. (Especially appropriate here in Syracuse, NY)</li>
                    
                    <li>D = nP¬≤ (The odds of hitting a duffed shot increase by the square of the number of people watching.)</li>
                    
                    <li>Don't play with anyone who would question a 7.</li>
                    
                    <li>When you look up and cause an awful shot, you will always look down again at exactly the moment when you ought to start watching the ball if you ever want to see it again.</li>
                    
                    <li>Since bad shots come in groups of three, a fourth bad shot is actually the beginning of the next group of three.</li>
                    
                    <li>It's often necessary to hit a second drive to really appreciate the first one.</li>
                    
                    <li>Nonchalant putts count the same as chalant putts.</li>
                    
                    <li>Whenever you play in a mixed foursome, there will always be at least one hole where you have to hit your second shot before the ladies tee off.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>And from someone on the net:</p>
                <p class="quote-style">You haven't really played golf until you've had to decide which opening in the trees gives you the best chance of getting back to the fairway.</p>
