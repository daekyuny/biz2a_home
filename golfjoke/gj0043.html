<h2>Some Quotes from Golf Digest Magazine</h2>
<p>The following are borrowed from the May '93 edition of Golf Digest:
<ol>
    <li>The score a player reports on any hole should be regarded as his opening 
    offer. 
    <li>When your shot has to carry over a water hazard, you can either hit 
    one more club or two more balls. 
    <li>If you really want to get better at golf, go back and take it up at 
    a much earlier age. 
    <li>When another foursome is on the green, &quot;Fore!&quot; is not an excuse, 
    &quot;So what?&quot; is not an apology, and &quot;Up yours&quot; is not 
    an explanation. 
    <li>Never leave your opponent with the sole responsibility for thinking 
    of all the things that might go wrong with his shot. 
    <li>The only sure way to find a drive sliced deep into the woods is to hit 
    a provisional ball 260 yards down the middle. 
    <li>The stages of a golfer's game are: Sudden Collapse, Radical Change, 
    Complete Frustration, Slow Improvement, Brief Mastery, and Sudden Collapse. 
    
    <li>Four days of perfect weather begin on Monday. (Especially appropriate 
    here in Syracuse, NY) 
    <li>$D = nP^2$ (The odds of hitting a duffed shot increase by the square 
    of the number of people watching.) 
    <li>Don't play with anyone who would question a 7. 
    <li>When you look up and cause an awful shot, you will always look down 
    again at exactly the moment when you ought to start watching the ball if 
    you ever want to see it again. 
    <li>Since bad shots come in groups of three, a fourth bad shot is actually 
    the beginning of the next group of three. 
    <li>It's often necessary to hit a second drive to really appreciate the 
    first one. 
    <li>Nonchalant putts count the same as chalant putts. 
    <li>Whenever you play in a mixed foursome, there will always be at least 
    one hole where you have to hit your second shot before the ladies tee off. 
    
</ol>
<p>And from someone on the net:</p>
<p>You haven't really played golf until you've had to decide which opening in 
the trees gives you the best chance of getting back to the fairway.</p>
