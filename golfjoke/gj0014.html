                <p>A man dies and approaches the pearly gates where he encounters St. Peter.</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"Ah," says St. Peter, "we've been expecting you. I'd like to let you walk through the pearly gates here, and looking through my book, I notice you've lived a good life....BUT...I see that one time, ONE TIME, you got a little angry and said the 'F' word, didn't you?"</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"Yes," says the man, "but it was only one time."</p>

                <p>St. Peter: <span class="quote-style">"Well, I've been known to make an exception when there are extenuating circumstances."</span></p>

                <p>Man: <span class="quote-style">"Well, I said the 'F' word when I was playing golf..."</span></p>

                <p>St. Peter: <span class="quote-style">"Oh, so you're a golfer, are you? Well that explains a lot. Go ahead and tell me why you said the 'F' word."</span></p>

                <p>Man: <span class="quote-style">"Well, I was playing in a tournament, and I had a one stroke lead. As I started into my backswing for my drive on the last hole, just at the peak of my swing, I realized that I had chosen the wrong club! I had the five iron instead of the four iron..."</span></p>

                <p>St. Peter: <span class="quote-style">"And THAT'S when you said the 'F' word?"</span></p>

                <p>Man: <span class="quote-style">"Well, no, as it turned out I hit the five iron shot of my life! The ball was headed straight up the fairway, when all of a sudden, a passing bird flew right into the ball's path..."</span></p>

                <p>St. Peter: <span class="quote-style">"You said the 'F' word then, didn't you?"</span></p>

                <p>Man: <span class="quote-style">"Well, no, just as the bird got to the ball, it started to hook, and the bird actually helped direct the ball towards the green where it landed and started to roll towards the cup! It was rolling real well, when all of a sudden, a squirrel came onto the green and came towards my ball..."</span></p>

                <p>St. Peter: <span class="quote-style">"The 'F' word, you said it then, yes?"</span></p>

                <p>Man: <span class="quote-style">"Well, the squirrel actually pushed the ball towards the hole, where it stopped rolling just about 2 inches from the cup..."</span></p>

                <p>St. Peter: <span class="quote-style">"YOU DIDN'T MISS THE FUCKING PUTT, DID YOU??"</span></p>
