<h2>Golf Lesson 101 (1)</h2>
<p>Me wife says to me one day ``Ain't it about time you learned to play this 
golf thing that all the other husbands are play'n?''</p>
<p>So I goes next door and says to me neighbor ``Can you teach me to play golf?''</p>
<p>He: ``Sure. Have you got any balls and club?''</p>
<p>Me: ``?.....of course. Why?''</p>
<p>H: ``Well bring'em to the club house tomorrow and we'll T-off.''</p>
<p>M: ``?T-off? Whats this T-off?''</p>
<p>H: ``Oh - its just a golf term and we'll T-off right next to the clubhouse.''</p>
<p>M: ``Look, you T-off where ever you want to but I'll T-off in private if 
you don't mind.''</p>
<p>H: ``(chuckle) No no, a T's that little thing about the size of your little 
finger.''</p>
<p>M: (them damn women been talk'n again)</p>
<p>H: ``Look, the first thing you do is stick you T in the ground and put you 
ball on top of it.''</p>
<p>M: ``Oh, this is sit down game?''</p>
<p>H: ``No, your standing up when you put your ball on the T.''</p>
<p>M: ``Is'nt that strech'n things a bit far?''</p>
<p>H: ``No. You got a bag to go along with your balls'n clubs?''</p>
<p>M: ``?.....of course. Why?''</p>
<p>H: ``Zippered bag or velcro?''</p>
<p>M: ``?...........neither.''</p>
<p>H: ``Oh, well how do you hold you club?''</p>
<p>I: ``Two fingers.''</p>
<p>H: ``No, no. That's not right. Look let me get around behind you like this. 
Now spread your feet apart a bit. Bend over a bit. Now I'll put my arms around 
you and show you how to swing.''</p>
<p>M: ``Damn man, I spent six years in the Navy and I know what you got on your 
mind.''</p>
<p>H: ``Ok, look, you take your club and swing it over your shoulder...''</p>
<p>M: ``No, no, that's me brother Jimmy you be think'n of.''</p>
<p>H: ``. . . and you hit your ball with it and it'll soar and soar.''</p>
<p>M: ``I can well belive that.''</p>
<p>H: ``Then when your on the green . . .''</p>
<p>M: ``What's the green thing?''</p>
<p>H: ``Ah, thats where the hole is.''</p>
<p>M: ``You color blind?''</p>
<p>H: ``No, why?'' ``...anyway, when you get there, you take your putter...''</p>
<p>M: ``Whats a putter?''</p>
<p>H: ``Smallest club made''</p>
<p>M: (DAMN that woman, just can't keep her mouth shut).</p>
<p>H: ``...and with it you put the ball in the hole.''</p>
<p>M: ``You mean the putter?'</p>
<p>H: ``No, the ball, the hole isn't big enough for the ball and the putter.''</p>
<p>M: ``Well - that's when I knew he didn't know what he was talk'n about. Cuz 
I seen holes big enough for a horse-n-wagon.''</p>
<p>H: ``Then after the first hole, you go on to the next 17.''</p>
<p>M: ``I quit. Takes me 18 days to make one hole. Besides, how would I know 
when I in the 18th one?''</p>
<p>H: ``Why, the holes got a flag in it.''</p>
<p>M: Sheeez!</p>
