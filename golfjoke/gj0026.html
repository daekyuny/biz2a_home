<h2>`F' Word (3)</h2>
<p>A man is playing alone behind a threesome of women on a busy weekend and 
the play is slow. When the man gets to the next tee the three women are about 
to hit and he asks them if he may join them in order to speed up play. They 
all agree that it is a good idea and form a foursome. All four hit good tee 
shots and walk out to their balls. The three women hit there second shots safely 
onto the green, the man hits his into a bunker next to the green an promptly 
yells </p>
<p>``aw S**T''. </p>
<p>When one of the women hears him she tells him that they will not tolerate 
his foul language. The man apologizes and they finish out the hole. When they 
get to the next tee the women who scolded him hits her tee shot well off to 
the right, it looks like it may be allright but it hits a tree and goes into 
the woods. She yell </p>
<p>``S**T'' and storms off the tee box. The man hearing this looks and the women 
and says `` I thought you wouldn't tolerate the use of that type of language''. 
She turns to him and says</p>
<p>``your ball didn't hit a F**KING tree''.</p>
