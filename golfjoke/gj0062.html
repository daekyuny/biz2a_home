<h2>Golfer's Regret ?</h2>
<p>I caught this in the rec.sport.golf:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;
&gt;In more than 20 years of playing, taking lessons, reading golf
&gt;magazines and watching instructional videotapes, here are the
&gt;numerical results:
&nbsp;
&gt;Approx. no. of holes played = 30,000
&gt;No. of holes in one = 0
&gt;No. of eagles          = 0
&gt;No. of birdies         = 1,000
&gt;No. of pars             = 3,000
&gt;No. of bogies or worse = 20,000+
&gt;No. of snowmen or worse = 5,000+
&gt;No. of putters used      = 30
&gt;No. of drivers used     = 100
&gt;No. of iron sets used   = 50
&gt;No. of lessons taken in which conflicting advice was given = 100
&gt;No. of times quit before 18 holes completed = 50
&gt;No. of times some SOB hit me with ball without shouting fore = 5
&gt;No. of rude playing partners = more than I can keep track of
&gt;Average No. of really good shots per round = 4
&gt;Average No. of lousy shots per round = 90
&gt;Lowest handicap ever achieved = 18
&gt;No. of times broken 90 without a mulligan  = 30
&gt;Lowest score ever for 18    =   83
&gt;Highest score ever for 18     = 126
&gt;Average No. of shanks per round =    at least 1, usually more
&gt;Average No. of topped or fat shots per round = 25
&gt;No. of back sprains or muscle pulls    = 12
&gt;No. of times quit game  for more
&gt;than one month                  =  5
&nbsp;
&gt;And this is supposed to be recreation?
&nbsp;
&gt;Though they might have decent athletic skills, some people such as
&gt;myself can never learn the game no matter what they do. The only
&gt;thing that keeps me coming back is the need to get out of the house
&gt;once in awhile and get some fresh air. Otherwise, I get virtually no
&gt;enjoyment from this so-called sport.
&nbsp;
&gt;I realize these sentiments will not be popular here, but I imagine
&gt;that most golfers (or hackers, more accurately) will agree with me
&gt;that, all things considered, golf is not much fun when taken too
&gt;seriously. As Bobby Jones said, &quot;If golf is worth playing, then it is
&gt;worth playing well.&quot;  Bogey golf or worse is unacceptable for anyone
&gt;with a sense of achievement.
&nbsp;
&gt;When you have invested as much sweat, time, money and effort as I
&gt;have for the past 20+ years and have gotten so little back, you have
&gt;to wonder whether the time was well spent. On reflection, I think I
&gt;might have received greater satisfaction and reward in some other
&gt;endeavor besides this humiliating game.
