                <div style="background: #f5f5f5; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #ccc; margin: 20px 0; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-line;">In more than 20 years of playing, taking lessons, reading golf
magazines and watching instructional videotapes, here are the
numerical results:

Approx. no. of holes played = 30,000
No. of holes in one = 0
No. of eagles          = 0
No. of birdies         = 1,000
No. of pars             = 3,000
No. of bogies or worse = 20,000+
No. of snowmen or worse = 5,000+
No. of putters used      = 30
No. of drivers used     = 100
No. of iron sets used   = 50
No. of lessons taken in which conflicting advice was given = 100
No. of times quit before 18 holes completed = 50
No. of times some SOB hit me with ball without shouting fore = 5
No. of rude playing partners = more than I can keep track of
Average No. of really good shots per round = 4
Average No. of lousy shots per round = 90
Lowest handicap ever achieved = 18
No. of times broken 90 without a mulligan  = 30
Lowest score ever for 18    =   83
Highest score ever for 18     = 126
Average No. of shanks per round =    at least 1, usually more
Average No. of topped or fat shots per round = 25
No. of back sprains or muscle pulls    = 12
No. of times quit game  for more
than one month                  =  5

And this is supposed to be recreation?

Though they might have decent athletic skills, some people such as
myself can never learn the game no matter what they do. The only
thing that keeps me coming back is the need to get out of the house
once in awhile and get some fresh air. Otherwise, I get virtually no
enjoyment from this so-called sport.

I realize these sentiments will not be popular here, but I imagine
that most golfers (or hackers, more accurately) will agree with me
that, all things considered, golf is not much fun when taken too
seriously. As Bobby Jones said, "If golf is worth playing, then it is
worth playing well."  Bogey golf or worse is unacceptable for anyone
with a sense of achievement.

When you have invested as much sweat, time, money and effort as I
have for the past 20+ years and have gotten so little back, you have
to wonder whether the time was well spent. On reflection, I think I
might have received greater satisfaction and reward in some other
endeavor besides this humiliating game.

There, I feel better now.
