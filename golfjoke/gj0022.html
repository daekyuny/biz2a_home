                <p>Jesus, Moses, and this old guy decided to play golf one day. On the first tee, Moses whacks the ball a beautiful one, sending it screaming towards the green, where it rolls to a stop, just a foot from the hole.</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"What do ya think of that?" he beamed.</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"That's nothing, step aside," Jesus replied serenely.</p>

                <p>If Moses' drive was a beautiful one, Jesus' was simply gorgeous. The ball fairly burned through the air as it headed for the green. It hit the green and rolled gently past Moses' ball, stopping a mere six inches from the hole.</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"Mind if I play now?" the old man spoke up. Jesus stepped aside and let the man tee up.</p>

                <p>The shot had vigor, mind you, but it hooked wildly into the trees and disappeared from sight. A second later, the trio heard a loud THWOCK and the ball sailed out of the trees, into the air, and across the fairway. It fell toward a water trap, but just before it hit, a fish leapt out of the water and snatched it out of the air. As the fish fell back to the water, a hawk, who had been disturbed when the ball hit its nest, swooped down and snatched the fish into the air and flew with it down the fairway. Just as the fish passed over the green, the ball fell out of its mouth, hit Moses' ball and bounced onto Jesus' ball and plunked into the hole.</p>

                <p>The old man leaned happily on his club and said, <span class="quote-style">"What do ya think of THAT?"</span></p>

                <p>Jesus snapped, <span class="quote-style">"Quit messing around, Dad, and let's play golf."</span></p>
