                <p>The worst (and wealthiest) member of Augusta approached Ben Crenshaw after the Master's Tournament. He challenged him to a match - double or nothing the prize money he had just won. Crenshaw was hesitant but hey who doesn't need more money right. To make it fair he offered the guy any handicap he wanted. The member requested 2 gotchas. Crenshaw wasn't sure what a gotcha was but since the man was insistent he agreed.</p>

                <p>They went out to the first tee and the member took a swing and his ball sliced mightily. Crenshaw got up and teed up his ball. The guy came up behind Crenshaw and swung his driver hard between his legs <span class="quote-style">"GOTCHA!"</span> he screamed.</p>

                <p>At the end of the round the people couldn't believe that Crenshaw had lost - his only comment <span class="quote-style">"Ever play a round of golf waiting for the second 'gotcha'?"</span></p>
