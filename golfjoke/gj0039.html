<h2>How to beat PGA Pros</h2>
<p>The worst (and wealthiest) member of Augusta approached Ben Crenshaw after 
the Master's Tournament. He challenged him to a match - double or nothing the 
prize money he had just one. Crenshaw was hesitant but hey who doesn't need 
more money right. To make it fair he offered the guy any handicap he wanted. 
The member requested 2 gottchas. Crenshaw wasn't sure what a gottcha was but 
since the man was insistent he agreed.</p>
<p>Then went out to the first tee and the member took a swing and his ball sliced 
mightily. Crenshaw got up and teed up his ball. The guy came up behind Crenshaw 
and swung his drive hard between his legs ``GOTTCHA!'' he screamed.</p>
<p>At the end of the round the people couldn't believe that Crenshaw had lost 
- his only comment ``ever play a round of golf waiting for the second ``gottcha''?</p>
