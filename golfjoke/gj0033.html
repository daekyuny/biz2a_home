                <p>A husband and wife died and went to Heaven together. They were met at the gates by an angel who was to show them the place. <span class="quote-style">"Right over here we have our very own golf course!"</span></p>

                <p><span class="quote-style">"Wow! It's beautiful! Can we play it now?!"</span> they both exclaimed.</p>

                <p><span class="quote-style">"Sure"</span> said the angel.</p>

                <p>So the couple began playing. It was the most beautiful course they had ever seen. Everything was perfect... the fairways, the greens, even the roughs. The more they played the more the woman beamed with happiness, but she noticed her husband was becoming disheartened and angry.</p>

                <p>The woman confronted her husband on what was wrong. <span class="quote-style">"I can't understand why you're not happy. We're in Heaven! We're together! We're playing on the most beautiful and most perfect golf course ever! What's wrong with you?"</span> she asked.</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"If you hadn't fed us those DAMN bran muffins, we'd been here years ago!"</p>
