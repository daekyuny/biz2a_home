<h2>Heavenly Golf (3)</h2>
<p>A husband and wife died and went to Heaven together. They were met at the 
gates by an angel who was to show them the place. Right over here we have our 
very own golf course!</p>
<p>Wow! It's beautiful! Can we play it now?! they both exclaimed.</p>
<p>Sure said the angel.</p>
<p>So the couple began playing. It was the most beautiful course they had ever 
seen. Everything was perfect... the fairways, the greens, even the roughs. The 
more they played the more the woman beamed with happiness, but she noticed her 
husband was becoming disheartened and angry.</p>
<p>The woman confronted her husband on what was wrong. I can't understand why 
you're not happy. We're in Heaven! We're together! We're playing on the most 
beautiful and most perfect golf course ever! What's wrong with you? she asked.</p>
<p>If you hadn't fed us those DAMN bran muffins, we'd been here years ago!</p>
