<h2>You can't keep your head down!</h2>
<p>A hack golfer spends a day at a plush country club, playing golf &gt; enjoying 
the luxury of a complimentary caddy. Being a hack golfer, he plays poorly all 
day. Round about the 18th hole, he spots a lake off to the left of the fairway. 
He looks at the caddy and says,</p>
<p>``I've played so poorly all day, I think I'm going to go drown myself in 
that lake.'' The caddy looks back at him and says, </p>
<p>``I don't think you could keep your head down that long.''</p>
