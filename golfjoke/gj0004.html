                <p>Two men were out playing a game of golf. One of them was teeing off at the third hole, when a gorgeous naked lady ran past. Naturally this distracted him somewhat, but the true wannabe pro that he was, he bent back to the much more important task at hand.</p>

                <p>As he was about to hit the shot again, two men in white coats ran past. This was of course less of a distraction, so it was only a few seconds before he was ready again.</p>

                <p>Surprise surprise, he was again distracted by a third man, running by in a white coat, but this man was carrying two buckets of sand.</p>

                <p>Eventually, he was ready again, and took his shot. As he was walking down the fairway, he asked his companion what he thought had been going on. His companion knew and told him:</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"Well that lady, once a week, manages to escape from the loony bin beside the course, tears off her clothes and runs across the fairways. The three guys you saw were the nurses. They have a race to see which can catch her first, and the winner gets to carry her back."</p>

                <p>"What about the bucket of sand?"</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"Well, that guy won last week, the buckets of sand are his handicap."</p>
