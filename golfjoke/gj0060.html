                <p>Four men, well along in years, had played golf as a foursome every Sunday morning, until one of them passed away. The other three asked the club pro if he could find them a compatible gentleman to fill out the foursome again. <span class="quote-style">"No problem,"</span> answered the pro.</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"But, you have to understand," one of the guys, named George, explained, "that Moe, who died, was like our eyes. We're all getting some cataracts, and have trouble seeing the ball. Moe's eyesight was perfect, and he was our spotter."</p>

                <p>The pro promised to see what he could do, and, when the others returned the following Sunday, he introduced them to a truly ancient looking gentleman, named Gary.</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"How old are you?" George asked.</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"I'm ninety-four," Gary responded.</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"Fabulous," said George. "But how's your eyesight?"</p>

                <p>At this, Gary blew up. <span class="quote-style">"Don't insult my eyes," he yelled. "I may be old, but I've got 20-20 vision. I have eyes like an eagle. Don't insult me!"</span></p>

                <p class="quote-style">"Okay, okay," the others said. "Let's play golf."</p>

                <p>George was first on the tee, and he hit a long, low drive, that faded significantly after about 200 yards. He turned to Gary.</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"Did you see where it went?" he asked the ancient one.</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"Did I see where it went?! I told you not to insult my eyesight. Of course I saw where it went. I've got eyes like an eagle!" Gary yelled.</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"Okay, I'm sorry," said George. "Where did it go?"</p>

                <p>Gary dropped his head, and muttered, <span class="quote-style">"I forgot."</span></p>
