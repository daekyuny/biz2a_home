<h2>Need a spotter ?</h2>
<p>Four men, well along in years, had played golf as a foursome every Sunday 
morning, until one of them passed away. The other three asked the club pro if 
he could find them a compatible gentleman to fill out the foursome again. ``No 
problem,'' answered the pro.</p>
<p>``But, you have to understand,'' one of the guys, named George, explained, 
``that Moe, who died, was like our eyes. We're all getting some cataracts, and 
have trouble seeing the ball. Moe's eyesight was perfect, and he was our spotter.''</p>
<p>The pro promised to see what he could do, and, when the others returned the 
following Sunday, he introduced them to a truly ancient looking gentleman, named 
Gary.</p>
<p>``How old are you?'' George asked.</p>
<p>``I'm ninety-four,'' Gary responded.</p>
<p>``Fabulous,'' said George. ``But how's your eyesight?''</p>
<p>At this, Gary blew up. ``Don't insult my eyes,'' he yelled. ``I may be old, 
but I've got 20-20 vision. I have eyes like an eagle. Don't insult me!''</p>
<p>``Okay, okay,'' the others said. ``Let's play golf.''</p>
<p>George was first on the tee, and he hit a long, low drive, that faded significantly 
after about 200 yards. He turned to Gary.</p>
<p>``Did you see where it went?'' he asked the ancient one.</p>
<p>``Did I see where it went?! I told you not to insult my eyesight. Of course 
I saw where it went. I've got eyes like an eagle!'' Gary yelled.</p>
<p>``Okay, I'm sorry,'' said George. ``Where did it go?''</p>
<p>Gary dropped his head, and muttered, ``I forgot.''</p>
