                <p>A couple of women were playing golf one sunny Saturday morning. The first of the twosome teed-off and watched in horror as the ball headed directly toward a foursome of men playing the next hole. Indeed, the ball hit one of the men and he immediately clasped his hands together at his crotch, fell to the ground and proceeded to roll around in agony. The woman rushed down to the man and immediately began to apologize. She then explained that she was a physical therapist and offered to help ease his "pain".</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"Please allow me to help, I am a physical therapist and I know I could relieve your pain if you'd just allow me!" She told him earnestly.</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"Ummph, oooh, nnnoo, I'll be alright...I'll be fine in a few minutes." He replied as he remained in the fetal position still clasping his hands together at his crotch.</p>

                <p>The woman takes it upon herself to begin to "ease his pain". She began to massage his groin (<em>okay, you use whatever term works for you</em>).</p>

                <p>After a few moments she asked, <span class="quote-style">"does that feel better?"</span></p>

                <p>The man looked up at her and replied, <span class="quote-style">"yes, that feels pretty good ...but my thumb still hurts like hell!"</span></p>
