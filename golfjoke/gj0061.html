<h2>Feeling good or healing hurts ?</h2>
<p>A couple of women were playing golf one sunny Saturday morning. The first 
of the twosome teed-off and watched in horror as the ball headed directly toward 
a foursome of men playing the next hole. Indeed, the ball hit one of the men 
and he immediately clasped his hands together at his crotch, fell to the ground 
and proceeded to roll around in agony. The woman rushed down to the man and 
immediately began to apologize. She then explained that she was a physical therapist 
and offered to help ease his ``pain''.</p>
<p>``Please allow me to help, I am a physical therapist and I know I could relieve 
your pain if you'd just allow me!'' She told him earnestly.</p>
<p>``Ummph, oooh, nnnoo, I'll be alright...I'll be fine in a few minutes.'' 
He replied as he remained in the fetal position still clasping his hands together 
at his crotch.</p>
<p>The woman takes it upon herself to begin to ``ease his pain''. She began 
to massage his groin (*okay, you use whatever term works for you*). </p>
<p>After a few moments she asked, ``does that feel better?''</p>
<p>The man looked up at her and replied, ``yes, that feels pretty good ...but 
my thumb still hurts like hell!''</p>
