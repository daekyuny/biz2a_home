<h2>Amazing Golf Ball</h2>
<p>These two guys were approaching the first tee. The first guy goes into his 
golf bag to get a ball and says to his friend, ``Hey, why don't you try this 
ball.'' He draws a green golfball out of his bag. ``You can't lose it.''</p>
<p>His friend replies, ``What do you mean you can't lose it?!!''</p>
<p>The first man replies, ``I'm serious, you can't lose it. If you hit it into 
the woods, it makes a beeping sound, if you hit it into the water it produces 
bubbles, and if you hit it on the fairway, smoke comes up in order for you to 
find it.''</p>
<p>Obviously, his friend doesn't believe him, but he shows him all the possibilities 
until he is convinced.</p>
<p>The friend says, ``Wow! That's incredible! Where did you get that ball!''</p>
<p>The man replies, ``I found it.''</p>
