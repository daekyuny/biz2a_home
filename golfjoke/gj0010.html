<h2>The rules of bedroom golf</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play, normally one club 
    and two balls. 
    <li>Play on a course must be approved by the owner of the hole. 
    <li>Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep 
    the balls out of the hole. 
    <li>For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft. Course owners 
    are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins. 
    <li>Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid damage 
    to the hole. 
    <li>The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary untill 
    the course owner is satisfied that the play is complete. Failure to do so 
    may result in being denied permission to play the course again. 
    <li>It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon 
    arrival at the course. The experienced player will normally take time to 
    admire the entire course, with special attention to well formed bunkers. 
    
    <li>Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played 
    or are currently playing to the owner of the course being played. Upset 
    course owners have been known to damage a player's equipment for this reason. 
    
    <li>Players are encouraged to bring proper rain gear for their own protection. 
    
    <li>Players should assure themselves that their match has been properly 
    scheduled, particularly when a new course is being played for the first 
    time. Previous players have been to become irate if they discover someone 
    else playing on what they consider to be a private course. 
    <li>Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at times. Some 
    players may be embarassed if they find the course to be temporarily under 
    repair. Players are advised to be extremely tactfull in this situation. 
    More advanced players will find alternate means of play when this is the 
    case. 
    <li>Players are advised to obtain course owner's permission before attempting 
    to play on the back nine. 
    <li>Slow play is encouraged. However, players should be prepared to proceed 
    at a quicker pace, at least temporarily, at the course owners request. 
    <li>It is considered outstanding performance, time permiting, to play the 
    same hole several times in one match. 
    <li>The course owner will be the sole judge of who is the best player. 
    <li>Players are advised to think twice before considering membership at 
    a given course. Additional assessments may be levied by course owner and 
    the rules are subject to change. For this reason, many players prefer continuing 
    to play several different courses. 
    <li>Once membership is established and accepted, playing other courses is 
    strictly FORBIDDEN. Any member caught playing another course is subject 
    to forfeiture of all equipment.
