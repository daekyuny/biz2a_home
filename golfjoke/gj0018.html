<h2>Not a bad deal, at all!!</h2>
<p>It was a beautiful sunny day at the golf course. The gentleman took aim on 
the ball and drove his first shot deep into a wooded area. He sighed and proceeded 
to the area where the ball had gone into the woods.</p>
<p>As he was looking around for his ball, he heard a voice calling to him. He 
whirled around and there stood a very ugly witch. She had his golf ball and 
explained to him that it had hit her in the head. She was not very pleased about 
this, but went on to explain that she had little contact with the outside world 
and when she did have an encounter, she condidered it a special occasion.</p>
<p>The witch said that she had magical powers and would grant the man one wish. 
However, when the wish was granted, the man would notice a tremendous decrease 
in his sexual desire and ability to perform. The man thought about this for 
a few minutes and then stated that he would agree to those conditions.</p>
<p>The witch asked what his wish was and the man simply stated, ``I want my 
golf game to improve.'' The witch rocked back on her heels and stared at the 
man. After a few minutes she said, ``Is that all?''. He said,'' Yes, that's 
it''. The witch said, ``Are you telling me that is all you want, when you could 
have anything in this world?'' The man looked her in straight in the eyes and 
said, ``Yes''.</p>
<p>Two years later, on another beautiful day, the man is at the same golf course 
and drives a tee shot into the woods. The man starts shaking because he had 
not hooked or sliced a shot since the day he had encountered the witch. He went 
into the woods and there stood the witch. She looked at him and said, ``I made 
your shot go bad because I wanted to talk to you.'' The man was visibly relieved 
when he heard this and asked what she wanted. The witch wanted to know if he 
had any regrets about his wish. The man said, ``Well, things couldn't be better 
with my golf game. I've won every major tournament on the amateur circuit and 
I'll soon be on the PGA tour. As far as my sex life, I have only had six encounters 
in 2 years. ``Hasn't that bothered you?,'' asked the witch. The man said, ``No, 
I'm allright''. The witch said,'' Well, I'm glad it all worked out, although 
there is nothing you or I can do about it now - the spell that was cast can 
never be changed''.</p>
<p>With that, they parted company. On his way out to the fairway, the man said 
to himself, ``The PGA Tour and sex three times a year - not bad for a small 
parish priest''.</p>
