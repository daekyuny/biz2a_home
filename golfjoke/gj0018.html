                <p>It was a beautiful sunny day at the golf course. The gentleman took aim on the ball and drove his first shot deep into a wooded area. He sighed and proceeded to the area where the ball had gone into the woods.</p>

                <p>As he was looking around for his ball, he heard a voice calling to him. He whirled around and there stood a very ugly witch. She had his golf ball and explained to him that it had hit her in the head. She was not very pleased about this, but went on to explain that she had little contact with the outside world and when she did have an encounter, she considered it a special occasion.</p>

                <p>The witch said that she had magical powers and would grant the man one wish. However, when the wish was granted, the man would notice a tremendous decrease in his sexual desire and ability to perform. The man thought about this for a few minutes and then stated that he would agree to those conditions.</p>

                <p>The witch asked what his wish was and the man simply stated, <span class="quote-style">"I want my golf game to improve."</span> The witch rocked back on her heels and stared at the man. After a few minutes she said, <span class="quote-style">"Is that all?"</span>. He said, <span class="quote-style">"Yes, that's it"</span>. The witch said, <span class="quote-style">"Are you telling me that is all you want, when you could have anything in this world?"</span> The man looked her straight in the eyes and said, <span class="quote-style">"Yes"</span>.</p>

                <p>Two years later, on another beautiful day, the man is at the same golf course and drives a tee shot into the woods. The man starts shaking because he had not hooked or sliced a shot since the day he had encountered the witch. He went into the woods and there stood the witch. She looked at him and said, <span class="quote-style">"I made your shot go bad because I wanted to talk to you."</span> The man was visibly relieved when he heard this and asked what she wanted. The witch wanted to know if he had any regrets about his wish. The man said, <span class="quote-style">"Well, things couldn't be better with my golf game. I've won every major tournament on the amateur circuit and I'll soon be on the PGA tour. As far as my sex life, I have only had six encounters in 2 years."</span> <span class="quote-style">"Hasn't that bothered you?"</span> asked the witch. The man said, <span class="quote-style">"No, I'm alright"</span>. The witch said, <span class="quote-style">"Well, I'm glad it all worked out, although there is nothing you or I can do about it now - the spell that was cast can never be changed"</span>.</p>

                <p>With that, they parted company. On his way out to the fairway, the man said to himself, <span class="quote-style">"The PGA Tour and sex three times a year - not bad for a small parish priest"</span>.</p>
