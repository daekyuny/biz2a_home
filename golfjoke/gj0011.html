<h2>Heavenly golf (1)</h2>
<p>One sunny day Jesus, Moses and an elderly small man were playing golf.</p>
<p>Jesus was the first to tee off and he hit the ball a little left and it ended 
up in the water hazard. Because it was Jesus, his ball floated and when he got 
down to the hazard he walked upon the water and hit the ball onto the green.</p>
<p>Moses was the next to tee off, and like Jesus he hit the ball into the water 
hazard. When he got down to the hazard, he parted the waters and hit the ball 
onto the green.</p>
<p>The little old man was next, and he too hit into the water hazard. Just then 
a big fish swallowed the ball and bagan the swim away. A hawk swooped down and 
grabbed the fish in its talons and started to fly away. As the hawk passed over 
the green, it tightened its grip on the fish which caused the ball to pop out 
of the fish. The ball landed on the green and rolled into cup.</p>
<p>Jesus then turned to the old man and said, ``look Dad, if you're going to 
play, play fair.''</p>
