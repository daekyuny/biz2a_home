<h2>`F' Word (2)</h2>
<p>Vicar George and Vicar Henry were out for a game of golf one day. On the 
first green, having missed a two foot putt, George screamed aloud, ``Fuck it, 
I missed!''. This really caught Vicar Henry by surprise but he decided to say 
nothing. </p>
<p>So, along the game went and on the third green Vicar George missed another 
simple putt. To Henry's surprise again, George shouted, ``Fuck it, I missed!''. 
Henry decided to calm George down a little and told him that the Lord would 
strike him down for using such foul language.</p>
<p>Anyway, both vicars played on, and George was able to control his temper 
until the final green where he missed yet another two-footer to win the match. 
Uncontrollably, the same, foul words came from his mouth, and in a flash, lightening 
came down from above, struck Vicar Henry, and killed him instantly. Suddenly, 
Vicar George heard a big booming voice from above, sounding the words: </p>
<p>``Dammit, I missed!''. </p>
