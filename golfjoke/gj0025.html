                <p>Vicar George and Vicar Henry were out for a game of golf one day. On the first green, having missed a two foot putt, George screamed aloud, <span class="quote-style">"Fuck it, I missed!"</span>. This really caught Vicar Henry by surprise but he decided to say nothing.</p>

                <p>So, along the game went and on the third green Vicar George missed another simple putt. To Henry's surprise again, George shouted, <span class="quote-style">"Fuck it, I missed!"</span>. Henry decided to calm George down a little and told him that the Lord would strike him down for using such foul language.</p>

                <p>Anyway, both vicars played on, and George was able to control his temper until the final green where he missed yet another two-footer to win the match. Uncontrollably, the same, foul words came from his mouth, and in a flash, lightning came down from above, struck Vicar Henry, and killed him instantly. Suddenly, Vicar George heard a big booming voice from above, sounding the words:</p>

                <p class="quote-style">"Dammit, I missed!"</p>
