<h2>Golfing on Mother's Day</h2>
<p>Three men gathered together for a round of golf on Mother's Day. The men 
were quite surprised at being ``let go'' for the day, and each wanted to know 
how the other got away from their wife.</p>
<p>The first man said, ``I purchased a dozen red roses for my wife, and she 
was so happy that she let me go.''</p>
<p>The second man said, ``I purchased a diamond ring for my wife, and she was 
so thrilled with me that she let me go.''</p>
<p>The third man said, ``I woke up this morning, rolled over, looked at my wife, 
and said to her: `Golf course or inter-course,' and she said: I'll put your 
clubs in the car.' ''</p>
