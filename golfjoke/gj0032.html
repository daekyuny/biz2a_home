<h2>Gamma Su !! Gamma Su !!</h2>
<p>A Texas business man while in Japan for some business meetings and a few 
rounds of golf, arrived in Tokyo a day earlier than expected. Feeling lonely 
that evening, he employed the services of a beautiful young Japanese girl to 
be his companion for the evening. Although, the Japanese girl spoke very little 
English and the businessman spoke no Japanese, their passion roared and in the 
heat of the moment she began yelling ``Gama Su!, Gama Su!''. Hearing this, the 
Texan knew he had pleased his female Japanese friend and soon afterwards went 
to sleep. </p>
<p>The next day while playing golf with his Japanese business colleagues, one 
of his Japanese partners holed his shot from 170 yards away! Everyone went crazy 
and began yelling excitedly in Japanese. Wanting to impress his friends, the 
Texan joined in and began yelling ``Gama Su! Gama Su!''. </p>
<p>Suddenly everyone became quiet. </p>
<p>After a moment of silence, one of the Japanese turned to him and asked: ``Wrong 
hole? What do you mean wrong hole?'' </p>
