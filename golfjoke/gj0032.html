                <p>A Texas business man while in Japan for some business meetings and a few rounds of golf, arrived in Tokyo a day earlier than expected. Feeling lonely that evening, he employed the services of a beautiful young Japanese girl to be his companion for the evening. Although, the Japanese girl spoke very little English and the businessman spoke no Japanese, their passion roared and in the heat of the moment she began yelling <span class="quote-style">"Gama Su!, Gama Su!"</span>. Hearing this, the Texan knew he had pleased his female Japanese friend and soon afterwards went to sleep.</p>

                <p>The next day while playing golf with his Japanese business colleagues, one of his Japanese partners holed his shot from 170 yards away! Everyone went crazy and began yelling excitedly in Japanese. Wanting to impress his friends, the Texan joined in and began yelling <span class="quote-style">"Gama Su! Gama Su!"</span>.</p>

                <p>Suddenly everyone became quiet.</p>

                <p>After a moment of silence, one of the Japanese turned to him and asked: <span class="quote-style">"Wrong hole? What do you mean wrong hole?"</span></p>
