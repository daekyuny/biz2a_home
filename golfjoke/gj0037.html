<h2>How to make a decent shot on a cart path ?</h2>
<p>Two guys of equal ability decide to have a round together and ``play it as 
it lays'' on all shots. Both hit their tee shots on the the par-5 No.1 hole 
down the middle and about 260. The drive up for the second shot, and the first 
gentleman hits his shot down the middle for an easy approach, but the second 
guy slices his over the trees and it ends up in the cart path of the adjoining 
hole. ``Guess I get a free drop from the cart path.'', he says. ``Oh no,'' says 
guy 1, ``We agreed. Play it as it lays.'' So guy 2 drives guy 1 up to his ball 
in front of the green, drops him off and drives over to his ball on the cart 
path. Guy 1 watches in amusement as sparks shower down from the practice swings 
of his opponent, then, in amazement as a perfectly struck shot lands on the 
green and roles to within 3 ft. of the pin. Guy 2 drives back to the green.</p>
<p>Guy 1: ``Great shot back there! What club did you use?''</p>
<p>Guy 2: ``Your six iron.''</p>
